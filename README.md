# Billboard-Hot100
In this project, I analyze data from the Billboard Hot 100 over the past 60 years.  This project is mainly an exercise in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

When looking at the notebook, use the link in the notebook or copy the url of the notebook into nbviewer to ensure that the Bokeh plots render properly.  Thank you!
