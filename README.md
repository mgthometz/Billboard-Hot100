# Billboard-Hot100
In this project, I analyze data from the Billboard Hot 100 over the past 60 years.  This project is mainly an exercise in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.  I will be expanding it frequently, so please check back soon to see a more complete analysis.  

When looking at the notebook, please use nbviewer to ensure that the Bokeh plots render properly.  Thank you!
